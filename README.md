## Auto Mod Config Preset

In order to create a Preset, there are three things required: 

1. The normal `About/About.xml` file
2. A single `ModlistConfigurator.ModlistPresetDef` that has a `defName`, `presetLabel` and `version`
3. All the configs for your Preset in a folder called `Settings`

Just like that, you can upload it to the Steam Workshop and any user who is subscribed to your Preset as well as
Auto Mod Config will have the settings for your Preset applied when loading Rimworld

To make the fact that your Preset is a Preset for Auto Mod Config, it's recommended that you add the following icon to
the corner of your thumbnail:
